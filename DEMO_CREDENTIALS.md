## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to load listings"
**Solutions:**
1. Check if backend is running on port 5000
2. Check if frontend is running on port 5174
3. Hard refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Clear browser cache and reload
5. Check browser console for CORS errors
6. Restart both servers:
   ```bash
   # In backend directory
   npm run dev

   # In frontend directory (separate terminal)
   npm run dev
   ```

### Issue: Cannot create listing
**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Ensure all required fields are filled
3. Add at least one image and one amenity
4. Check backend logs for errors

### Issue: Login not working
**Solutions:**
1. Use exact email and password: `password123`
2. Check if backend is running
3. Clear browser localStorage and try again

## Current Application Status

- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:5174/
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:5000/
- **Mode**: Mock Data (No MongoDB required)
- **Total Listings**: 28 properties
- **Total Users**: 5 demo users

---

## Important Notes

1. **Mock Data Mode**: The application is running with in-memory mock data. All changes (new listings, bookings, etc.) will be lost when the server restarts.

2. **Password Security**: In production, passwords would be properly hashed and secured. The demo uses bcrypt hashing.

3. **Image URLs**: Use valid image URLs for testing. Unsplash URLs work great for demo purposes.

4. **Authentication**: JWT tokens are stored in localStorage and valid until logout.

5. **CORS**: CORS is configured to accept requests from localhost:5174 (frontend).
